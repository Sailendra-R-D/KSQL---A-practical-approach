Repartition
-----------
When you use KSQL to join streaming data, you must ensure that your streams and tables are co-partitioned,
which means that input records on both sides of the join have the same configuration settings for partitions.

kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1 --topic DRIVER_PROFILE

kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic DRIVER_PROFILE << EOF
{"driver_name":"Mr. Speedy", "countrycode":"AU", "rating":2.4}
EOF

CREATE STREAM DRIVER_PROFILE (driver_name VARCHAR, countrycode VARCHAR, rating DOUBLE) \
WITH (VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON', KAFKA_TOPIC = 'DRIVER_PROFILE');

select dp.driver_name, ct.countryname, dp.rating \
from DRIVER_PROFILE dp \
left join COUNTRYTABLE ct on ct.countrycode=dp.countrycode;

Can't join DRIVER_PROFILE with COUNTRYTABLE since the number of partitions don't
match. DRIVER_PROFILE partitions = 2; COUNTRYTABLE partitions = 1. Please
repartition either one so that the number of partitions match.

We can fix this by co-partitioning, use the PARTITION BY clause. At KSQL prompt

create stream driverprofile_rekeyed with (partitions=1) as select * from
DRIVER_PROFILE partition by driver_name;

select dp2.driver_name, ct.countryname, dp2.rating
from DRIVERPROFILE_REKEYED dp2
left join COUNTRYTABLE ct on ct.countrycode=dp2.countrycode;
